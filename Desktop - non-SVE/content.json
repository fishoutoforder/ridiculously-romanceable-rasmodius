			"spring_Sat4": "Once, an animal went into the depths of my tower and used the Shrine of Illusion. It transformed into what it truly wanted to be seen as.#$b#Out walked a being of nightmare, and I had to find a place for it to thrive.

In the end, we broke up, and it wasn't pretty.{{sad}}#$b#Many people still remember her flying around, cursing all she saw. I still feel responsible.{{sad}}#$e#Embrace the mysteries of the day, @.",
			"spring_Wed6": "We had similar interests, my ex-wife and I. We would spend hours in each other's arms, reading forbidden books.#$b#In the end, what we couldn't decide on was how to live. We were very different people.#$b#If only things could have been different.{{sad}}#$e#Have a good day, @. Learn something new.",

It would have been better if you hadn't gotten involved.#$e#Seek knowledge, seek answers. Have a good one.",

			"spring_Wed8": "I will tell you of one place that I have been to. While lost in a forest, I found a cabin and took shelter in it.#$b#It was larger than it appeared on the inside, and it seemed to go on for miles.#$b#At the end, I found a bed, and in it, a child. Its eyes were open, and it rose to stare at me.#$b#It pointed at me, and I awoke in my bed at the inn. Very strange, and I still wonder about it.#$e#Have a good day, @. Learn something new.",
			"spring_Thu8": "Walking the libraries of the world, even if you cannot understand the language, is an inspiring feeling. The energy one gains by being near books is great.#$b#I used to spend hours in them, absorbing it all. Many are now gone, and it is a shame.#$e#Seek the energies, @. Enjoy the day.",
			"spring_Fri8": "Where I come from the libraries would be brimming with life. Every page a portal, recorded down by scribes long past.#$b#Some were full of secrets no one should know, and I took to them immediately. I regret it still.{{sad}}#$e#Focus your mind today, @, and be at peace.",
			"spring_Sat8": "The world I once knew is long gone. I hold onto fragments of it, but I am old. Someday, it will all be forgotten.{{sad}}#$b#I'd like to tell you about it, @, but no energy in the universe would allow me to discuss it. As is the way.#$e#Seek knowledge, seek answers. Have a good one.",
			"spring_Sun8": "I wish I could go back to the days of my youth for one more day. Go into the shops I always put off, talk to the librarians, learn even more.#$b#Those days are long gone, and all I have left of them is a shadow. Such is life.{{sad}}#$e#Be enchanted, @. Be at peace.",
			"spring_Mon10": "Despite the focus I have on my studies, I have always wanted to be a father.#$b#Would it be presumptuous of me to ask how you feel about children?{{love}}#$e#Perhaps we could...{{love}}#$b#Well.{{embarassed}}#$b#Never mind.{{embarassed}}",

			"spring_Wed10": "Many people are scared of me. The unknown causes them to tremble, and my association with it frightens them.#$b#You have continued to show you don't mind the mysterious. You embrace it, and take time out of your day to see me.#$b#Thank you, @. I thought I would be alone forever.{{happy}}#$e#You are a special person, indeed.{{happy}}",
			"spring_Thu10": "The energies, at their core, are chaotic. Ever changing, they are denser than air yet more elusive than wind.#$b#In the end, many people believed it was not worth trying to solve the mystery, yet here I remain.#$e#Someday, @, I will truly understand.",
			"spring_Fri10": "I feel renewed this year, not just because spring is the time for it, but because of my relationship with you, @.{{happy}}#$b#You have reminded me that I am still human. To focus on being human is a mystery itself that I almost forgot about.{{happy}}#$e#Thank you, @.{{happy}}",

			"summer_Mon": "The many eared crop, its leaves capture the sun's energy itself, painting it all over.#$b#Amazing in its uses, it's true desire is to feed people. An inspiring crop indeed.#$e#Have a day to remember, @.",
			"summer_Tue": "The bush with eyes of blue, it can see many things. Its power is in healing, and as such, is quite potent indeed.#$b#People crave them, but they are hard to find most of the year, and only good fresh. A crop whose quality is fleeting, very mysterious.#$e#Embrace the mysteries of the day, @.",

			"summer_Thu": "It is now that the crops that can make energy are born, and it is up to people like yourself to harness it.#$b#There are two crops available, and one has its seeds. To utilize them is pure alchemy.#$e#Seek the energies, @. Enjoy the day.",
			"summer_Fri": "A powerful plant, it can induce dreams in those who drink it. Its powers many, its flavors are endless.#$b#Yet, it has brought ruin to civilizations, and is no friend of men or women. What is its true purpose?#$e#Focus your mind today, @, and be at peace.",
			"summer_Sat": "The energy of the sun is too much for some, and the only solution is to stay indoors. I hide within my tower for this purpose.#$b#Yet, the energies are so powerful during time of year that I do not even need sleep. Isn't it wondrous?#$e#Seek knowledge, seek answers. Have a good one.",
			"summer_Sun": "The red crop, vegetable to some and fruit to others, has no keeper. It is delicious raw, cooked, or squeezed.#$b#Many people like it, and some can't live without it. No home should lack it's prescence.#$e#Be enchanted, @. Be at peace.",
			"summer_Mon2": "Long ago, there was a language that allowed people to converse with the spirits of the sun. They held many festivals during summer.#$b#That culture is long gone, and the language of the sun lost to time. If only I could find a way...#$e#Have a day to remember, @.",
			"summer_Tue2": "The energy during summer allows for easier methods of the mysterious. It is very addicting trying out new theories after two seasons of wondering.#$b#Can you feel the energies? Do not worry if you cannot.#$e#Embrace the mysteries of the day, @.",
			"summer_Wed2": "It was said that only the most powerful could learn and write the Sun Language, for it could burn those who wrote it.#$b#It is rumored that there was a rival tribe that wrote in a special moon rune, but there has been no proof of such a language ever existing.#$e#Have a good day, @.

Strange, isn't it? Someday I might be able to show you, but not now.#$e#Focus your mind today, @, and be at peace.",
			"summer_Sat2": "Tomorrow I will be focusing my energy, and doing an experiment that could go very well, or very badly. If you see me, I will be in a trance.#$b#If it works, then you'll wake up and everything will be fine. If it doesn't, well, I did try.#$e#Seek knowledge, seek answers. Have a good one.",

He was wealthy, and won the shrine in a contest.#$b#He invested all his wealth into it, trying to find the perfect look, but he was never happy.#$b#He was trying to fix what was on the outside and not the inside, and it consumed him. Strange, isn't it?#$e#Embrace the mysteries of the day, @.",
			"summer_Wed4": "I found a warning in an old book regarding the Shrine of Illusion. It went as follows:#$b#'Only those who wish to find their true self are permitted to use the Shrine. Those who wish to change their appearance to trick others shall be cursed.'#$b#I've spent a long time trying to find what the curse is, but only have theories.#$e#Have a good day, @. Learn something new.",
			"summer_Thu4": "My guesses for the Curse of the Shrine of Illusion are that if you use it for your own gain, and not to reveal your true self, your time on this mortal plane is cut short.#$b#Many have tried to use it as such, and all were destroyed. But this is just a theory of mine, nothing concrete about it.#$e#Seek the energies, @. Enjoy the day.",
			"summer_Fri4": "It is curious to me why the Shrine demands gold for its use. If it was a construct of good, it shouldn't matter.#$b#Yet, it will not work without a gold offering. Such a curious thing.#$e#Focus your mind today, @, and be at peace.",
			"summer_Sat4": "There is no proof of any kind that the Shrine of Illusion is more powerful during summer or not. All other sorts of mysterious objects are, but it appears indifferent.#$e#Seek knowledge, seek answers. Have a good one.",
			"summer_Sun4": "I believe you to be a good person, @, so the Shrine should be kind to you. If I misjudged you, then...#$b#You might still be fine. I'll have to see.#$e#Be enchanted, @. Be at peace.",
			"summer_Mon6": "My ex-wife was my companion. We did many things together, and during summer, when the energies are so potent, it was truly wonderful.{{happy}}#$b#Now, I am alone in this tower. It is not the same, and probably will never be again.{{sad}}#$e#Have a day to remember, @.",
			"summer_Tue6": "I have the ability to create an image of any being and converse with it. However, they bore me, and I bore them.#$b#They claim I need to get over my ex-wife, but it's easier said than done.{{sad}}#$e#Embrace the mysteries of the day, @.",
			"summer_Wed6": "To be lucky in love is a special sort of energy that not all beings possess. It strikes randomly, and only once.#$b#I have been hoping for another chance for many years, but to no avail.{{sad}}#$e#Have a good day, @. Learn something new.",
			"summer_Thu6": "I once conjured a being that was a talking cat. It would go on and on about facts from around the world, but it was only things I knew.#$b#I couldn't bring myself to send it away, so I gave it to a friend. I wonder where it is now.#$e#Seek the energies, @. Enjoy the day.",
			"summer_Fri6": "The summer full moon is a special one for me. I proposed to my ex-wife underneath it's power.#$b#It was...enchanting.{{happy}}#$b#That was a very long time ago.{{sad}}#$e#Focus your mind today, @, and be at peace.",
			"summer_Sat6": "It is a dangerous power to wonder about how things could have been. It is impossible to know, but it can be a destructive force.#$b#It's better to always do what you feel is right so you have no regrets. Doing what you feel is wrong, but doing it anyway, is madness.#$e#Seek knowledge, seek answers. Have a good one.",
			"summer_Sun6": "The days are long, @. I am in a slump, but I can feel a time when I will soon rise above it.#$b#I let the powers of the past take over me, and I tell you this, I will break free of them.#$e#Be enchanted, @. Be at peace.",
			"summer_Mon8": "One of things I did when I was younger was hunt and fight evil beings and creatures.
