<h1>What is this mod about?</h1>
<p>This is a self-indulgent fork of the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3073">Romanceable Rasmodius mod</a> that re-writes the dialogue for the wizard in Stardew Valley, so that he is tailored to my exact husbando preferences.  I want to be clear - this is not because the writing for the original mod was poor. This is simply because I am a woman of particular and specific tastes, with the ability to make those tastes a reality via modding ;) As this is my first mod, it was much easier to get started with an existing, functional dialogue-altering mod, to then build on. I am very grateful to the mod creators for explicitly allowing their mod to be used in this way.</p>
<p><b>Credits for the three mods that led to this one:</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1309">haywrites</a> (original extended dialogue mod),</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3073">WerewolfHunter</a> (original Romance version of mod) and</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/7000?tab=description">PaintedParrot</a> (SVE version of romance mod)</li>
  </ul>
<h1>What makes this mod different to the original(s)?</h1>
<p>Almost all the dialogue is completely re-written from the original mod. Long term, I'd like to add more events and other content too (see "<a href="#long-term">Long term additions</a>").</p>
<h2>Narrative alternations in detail</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The wizard is now much more (platonically) interested in you right from the start. He talks with the forest about you regularly.</li>
    <li>As someone who rarely interacts with 'normal' people, he makes even more social faux pas.</li>
    <li>We learn more about how he became a wizard in later stages of the friendship.</li>
    <li>He talks more about the townspeople (still very much from an 'outsider' point of view) and is less judgemental of them than he appears in early heart levels in the original mod.</li>
    <li> He discusses his views on forest magic in more detail.</li>
    <li>His neurodivergent traits are more recognisable (I like to see my own brain stuff represented in games).</li>
    <li>He draws a little on my love for Discworld wizards, in that he's a little goofier, flying by the seat of his pants more than he appears to in vanilla, and very fond of good food.</li>
    <li>He's still the witch's ex-husband, and this relationship is discussed, though I take a slightly different approach to the finer details of what happened, compared to the original mod. The witch is always painted in a good light. They really were both just too young and too caught up in th thrill of being powerful mages to realise their deeper incompatibilities.</li>
    <li>Any references to the fan-rumour of the wizard potentially being Abigail's dad are removed. I totally get why they were in there, and I'm not saying this fan theory doesn't have legs, because yeah, Abigail's hair colour and Pierre being a pretty uninspiring husband does make one wonder. However, I just really don't like the whole cheating thing (okay, maybe she slept with the wizard and then accepted previously rebuffed affections from Pierre so that her baby could have a 'normal' life, but... I just don't like it? So this fan-theory is not canon for <i>my</i> wizard.)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Next steps for this mod</h1>
<h2>What I'm currently working on</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>SVE-compatible, Android-compatible version</b> I am currently re-writing the entirety of the mod to match with my writing summary above, specifically to run on my Android device with Stardew Valley Expanded compatibility. Progress: ~20% written.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Once the initial re-write is completed:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>SVE-compatible, 1.5 compatible version</b> I will take my writing across to a 1.5-compatible, SVE compatible version, usable on PC.</li>
  <li><b>Non-SVE, 1.5 compatible version</b> I will take my writing across to a 1.5 compatible version of the mod, tailored to work in games that do not use SVE (I will do my best to avoid incompatibility with other popular map mods, such as East Scarpe).</li>
  <li>Once I've learned more about modding Stardew Valley from tinkering with this mod, I may well actually just throw out everything but my dialogue, and rebuild the mod entirely from scratch to better suit the way I prefer to code things. (Such a breaking dialogue across multiple files that will be included based on settings players choose in the config, etc.) At that point I'd no longer consider this a fork of the Romanceable Rasmodius mod, as I won't be using any of the dialogue or code at that point. We'll see if I get competent enough to reach that point!</li>
</ul>
<h2 name="long-term">Long term additions I would like to make</h2>
<ul>
  <li>More events (SVE and non-SVE compatible).</li>
  <li>More custom reactions to gifts, that vary by heart level (like the <a href="https://www.moddrop.com/stardew-valley/mods/487802-immersive-characters-shane">Immersive Shane mod)</a></li>
  <li>More unique dialogue triggers based on the exact day, heart level, and recent events.</li>
  <li>Option to have the wizard use gender-neutral pronouns for the farmer.</li>
  <li>Option to have special dialogue that implies the wizard literally WAS a Discworld wizard, which would be set to 'false' by default. If enabled, it will include references to the Discworld universe, with the implication being that the wizard was transported into the universe of Stardew Valley due to an L-Space mixup, and decided he liked it here better.</li>
  <li>Option to include alternate backstory for Abigail's purple hair, set to false by default. Essentially, that Caroline and Pierre wound up going to the wizard regarding fertility issues, and he did some Wacky Magic involving precious stones to help with conception. I know, it's a silly idea, but that's why it will be set to 'false' by default.</li>
</ul>
<h1>This is a work in progress - and may never be formally made into an official mod release.</h1>
<p>I am working on this for myself, and am not sure if I will formally release this mod on any hosting sites at this stage. I wanted to make the project avaiable on GitHub either way, however, for anyone who is interested, and honestly just for the experience of managing a simple GitHub project on my own, as all my other experiences with Git have been as a contributor on internalonly work projects, where I didn't have to manage anything but my own small part of the code.</p>
