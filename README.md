# ridiculously-romanceable-rasmodius
A self-indulgent fork of the Romanceable Rasmodius mod that re-writes the wizard's dialogue so that he is tailored to my exact preferences. His neurodivergent traits are more recognisable (I like to see my brain stuff represented in games), he acts more like a Discworld wizard (bar the "no makeouts" rule), and any references to the fan-rumour of him potentially being Abigail's dad are removed. Initially I am focusing on modifying the SVE-compatible version of the mod that works on my Android setup. Then I'll move to replicating this for the current non-SVE and SVE versions of the original mod. Finally, I'd like to add more events, custom gift reactions, and a few other special things to make this romance extremely packed with content. Original mod is used with permission from the creator.
